 Implementing Trees requires the following
 • A struct to represent the Tree structure:
    - A variable to hold the tree node value
    - An empty array of the Tree type to hold the children nodes.
    - A custom initializer that initializes the value property to self
 • The add method to add values to the tree
    - This should just be an append method that appends a new node to the child array
 • A queue for BFS taversal.
